# AI-Scythe\n\n<i> Under development </i> Deep learning library based on deep forests\n\nA deep forest consists of a stack of layers, where each of them learns from both the input features and the output features of the previous layer. Each layer is made of a series of complete-random forests. This results in a whole hierarchy of predictors, from single trees to deep forests.\n\nThe rationale behind this project is to solve the problem of high dimensionality of fine-grained scanners.
